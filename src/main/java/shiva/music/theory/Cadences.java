Finished cadences:

Authentic/Perfect Cadence: V-I  - Sounds the most finished

Plagal Cadence: IV-I  (Amen cadence) Sounds pretty finished


Unfinished cadences:

Half/Imperfect Cadence: Ends on V. Can start on I, II or IV. 

Interrupted/Deceptive Cadence: V-IV (sounds like the music has been interrupted)
